# [origin:virus] ORIGIN 
¿What is COVID-19?
It is a new disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 means “COronaVIrus Disease 2019”.

¿Which is the origin of COVID-19?
Many researchers are agree that the virus of COVID-19 has an animal origin, most likely bats.

¿Was the virus of COVID-19 made in a laboratory?
No. If the virus of COVID-19 would be created in a laboratory, its genes would have known sequences (parts). This is not the case.

¿What does the mutation of COVID-19 mean?
All viruses change or mutate developing new “variants”, some more so than others. These mutations could change the transmissibility and severity of the disease. The COVID-19 virus changes rather slowly compared to influenza virus or HIV.

# [transmission:share] TRANSMISSION 
Mainly, COVID-19 is transmitted through little drops expelled when an infected person breathes, speaks, sings, sneezes or coughs. These drops could be spread around 6 feet (2 meters) and get caught through the eyes, nose, and or mouth of others close to the infected person.

¿Could COVID-19 be spread by touching contaminated things?
Rarely. When a person touches contaminated objects (tables or door handles used by a sick person) and then touches their eyes, nose and mouth without washing their hands previously is when a person may become infected.

¿Could asymptomatic people transmit the COVID-19 virus?
Yes, symptomatic and asymptomatic people could transmit the COVID-19 virus. It is likely that transmission of the virus by asymptomatic people is the reason for most cases in the world.

¿Does getting infected with the COVID-19 virus mean that I will have the virus in my body forever?
No. Most of the people infected by COVID-19 virus recover and eliminate the virus. Some people could continue having symptoms months later but it does not mean that they have the virus in their bodies.

¿Could shoes spread the COVID-19 virus?
The chance that the virus could be spread by shoes is really unlikely. Shoes could be left at the entrance of houses where there are kids playing or crawling on the floor.

¿Could houseflies transmit the COVID-19 virus?
No. To date, there isn’t any evidence showing that houseflies could spread the COVID-19 virus.

¿May 5G mobile networks transmit the COVID-19 virus?
No. Viruses cannot travel through radio waves or mobile networks. Viruses need a cell to stay alive. Places where there isn’t any 5G mobile network, have COVID-19 cases.

¿Could the COVID-19 virus be transmitted by mosquito bites?
No. To date, there isn’t any research showing that mosquito bites could spread the COVID-19 virus.

¿May blood products transmit the COVID-19 virus?
To date, there isn’t any evidence suggesting that the COVID-19 virus could be transmitted through blood products.

¿Can the COVID-19 virus be spread in places with hot and wet weather?
Yes. The COVID-19 virus could be transmitted in any place, whatever it is sunny or cold. Countries with hot weather have COVID-19 cases. 

¿May the COVID-19 virus be spread through water?
No. The COVID-19 virus cannot be spread through water whether we are in the sea or swimming pool. Keep at least 1 meter apart from others and wear a mask outside the water.

# [symptons:sick] SYMPTOMS 
Our body could react in different ways to the COVID-19 virus. Reactions can vary from having no symptoms (asymptomatic) to  severe cases where the lungs, heart, kidneys, liver, blood vessels and even nervous system can be damaged.

¿When symptoms begin?
COVID-19 symptoms could begin up to 14 days after a person is infected with the virus.

¿When should people quarantine or self isolate? 
Quarantine: If a person was in close contact with someone with COVID-19, they should stay at home for 14 days regardless if their laboratory results are, positive or negative.
Isolation: If a person has COVID-19, they should stay at home for at least 10 days from the onset of symptoms and up to 3 days after symptoms have improved or without a fever.

¿Which are COVID-19 symptoms?
The most known symptoms are:
- Fever (body temperature higher than 38°C) or chills. Most of elderly people do not develop fever.
- cough
- breathing difficulty (feeling a lack of air)
- body or muscle aches
- headache
- sickness
- nasal congestion and runny nose
- loss of smell
- loss of taste
- sore throat
- stomachache (abdominal pain)
- lack of appetite
- nausea and vomiting
- tiredness or fatigue
- delusions (in elderly people)

¿When should I go to the hospital?
Go to the hospital's emergency service immediately if you have:
- Fever for more than 2 days.
- Breathing difficulty.
- Chest ache or oppression
- Awakeness difficulty
- Blue lips or face (cyanosis)
- Oxygen saturation less than 95%. A person with COVID-19 may not aware when their saturation is going down.

¿Could asymptomatic people get sick after all?
Yes. There have been asymptomatic people who develop pneumonia.

¿Could someone who had COVID-19 continue having symptoms?
Yes. Some people who had COVID-19 can continue having symptoms as fatigue or tiredness, breathing difficulty, chest ache, palpitations, mental problems, loss of smell or taste, numbness of arms and legs for months. If symptoms persist, go to the doctor.

# [conditions:accessibility_new] PEOPLE WITH SPECIAL CONDITIONS
## [risky_people:accessibility_new] People at risk
People at higher risks to developing severe COVID-19 symptoms have the following conditions:
- Older than 65 
- Arterial hypertension
- Cardiovascular diseases (stroke) 
- Diabetes
- Chronic lung diseases (asthma, chronic bronchitis)
- Chronic liver diseases
- Immunosuppressive treatment (cancer or transplant rejection treatment)
- Kidney diseases (renal insufficiency)
- Obesity
- Blood disorders (sickle cell disease)

¿Does the COVID-19 virus infect more elderly or young people? 
Anyone of any age can be infected by the COVD-19 virus.

## [pregnant:pregnant_woman] Pregnant women
Pregnant women can develop mild COVID-19 symptoms, which can be managed with medical care at home. However, pregnant women experiencing severe COVID-19 symptoms will need hospitalization.

¿Are pregnant women are more at risk of developing severe COVID-19?
Pregnant women who are older or are overweight, or have hypertension, diabetes or other diseases may be at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19.

¿Could a pregnant woman transmit the COVID-19 virus to her baby?
To date it is unknown. Nothing has been found to indicate that the COVID-19 virus can reside in the fluid surrounding the baby in the womb.

¿Should delivery of a pregnant woman who had COVID-19 be induced earlier?
No. A pregnant woman who recovered from COVID-19 has the same delivery schedule as someone who did not have COVID-19.

¿Should the delivery of a pregnant woman with COVID-19 be by cesarean section?
No. The delivery by cesarean section should only be indicated if it is medically needed (for the mother or baby benefit).

¿Could a mother with COVID-19 breastfeed her baby?
Yes. If a mother has COVID-19 she should wash her hands carefully and wear a mask before breastfeeding. To date, the COVID-19 virus has not been found in breastmilk.

## [children:child] Children
The amount of hospitalizations and admissions to the intensive care unit is lower in children than in adults. Apparently, COVID-19 could be less severe in children.
IMPORTANT: Children younger than 2 should not wear a mask.

¿Which child is at risk of developing severe COVID-19?
It is likely that children who are immunocompromised (with low defenses) or with chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma or cardiovascular diseases could be at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19.

¿What is multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C)?
It is a complication of COVID-19 in children and teenagers. They have fever for 3 days, systemic inflammation and impaired organs such as heart, kidney, skin, blood, digestive system and nervous system. There have been many cases but fortunately few deaths.

## [cancer:sick] Cancer
¿Does a person with cancer have higher risk of developing severe COVID-19?
It is likely that people with cancer who are on treatment may develop severe COVID-19.

¿Is someone who recovered from cancer are at higher risk to develop severe COVID-19?
It is not clear whatever people who had cancer are at higher risk of becoming ill seriously of COVID-19.

¿Do children with cancer are at lower risk than adults to develop severe COVID-19?
It appears that children with cancer develop a milder COVD-19 than adults with cancer.

¿Which tests should be used if a person has cancer?
It is recommended to use molecular tests if a person with cancer develop COVID-19 symptoms.

## [cancer:sick] HIV
¿Which symptoms a person with HIV could develop if they have COVID-19?
A person living with HIV on regularly antiretroviral treatment can develop similar COVID-19 symptoms than a person without HIV.

¿Do people with HIV be on higher risk to develop severe COVID-19?
To date, there is no evidence suggesting that people living with HIV are at higher risk to be infected or develop severe COVID-19.

## [cancer:sick] Tuberculosis (TB)
¿How the fight against tuberculosis has been affected by the pandemic?
Of 4 people who normally had to be diagnosed with tuberculosis, due to the pandemic, only 3 were diagnosed. This person without Tuberculosis diagnosis is not on treatment and is spreading the bacillus of Tuberculosis right now without knowing it.

¿Does a person with tuberculosis is on a higher risk to get ill seriously of COVID-19?
It seems that Tuberculosis treatment outcome of a person who also has COVID-19 would not be good, especially if they stop their Tuberculosis treatment.

¿Does the transmission of tuberculosis and COVID-19 happen in the same way?
Tuberculosis and COVID-19 are spread when someone ill is in close contact to a healthy person.
When someone with Tuberculosis coughs, sneezes, sings or yells expels bacilli of tuberculosis that could be in the air for many hours. A healthy person could get tuberculosis infection if breathe these bacilli. The amount of bacilli decrease with sunlight and natural ventilation.

¿Does a person with tuberculosis have a different TB treatment if they get infected with the virus of COVID-19?
Most of tuberculosis treatments are not different with or without COVID-19. Preventive (prophylaxis) treatment and tuberculosis disease treatment do not have to be stopped. Of 2 people who stop TB treatment, 1 could die.

# [detection:diagnoses] TESTS
There are 2 types:
- Molecular tests (identify the virus of COVID-19) 
- Serological tests (identify the antibodies generated by the body when get infected by the virus of COVID-19)

¿When molecular tests could get positive?
In most COVID-19 cases, 5 days after a person has been infected.

¿When serological tests could get positive?
Most of people with COVID-19 has positive serological tests 21 days or more after the onset of symptoms.

¿What is a rapid test?
A rapid test is a molecular test type; it is fast but sometimes its result is not accurate.

¿How to know if someone has COVID-19?
To know if someone has COVID-19 it is recommended to use a molecular test.

¿How to know if someone had COVID-19?
To know if someone has COVID-19 it is recommended to use a serological test and also a molecular test (to make sure that the virus of COVID-19 is no longer in the body).

¿Could serological tests determine if someone can go back to their work?	
It is not recommended. Serological tests shouldn’t determine if a person could back to work, college, school or any other place where people group.

¿Could someone who had COVID-19 get infected again (reinfection)?
There have been some COVID-19 cases of reinfection although they are rare. Antibodies generated by our body may not last forever or may not protect our body of a second infection (reinfection).

¿Could thermal scanners detect the virus of COVID-19?
No. Thermal scanners detect if someone has fever, no the COVID-19 virus. There are many diseases which could produce fever.

¿Does being able to hold the breath for 10 seconds or more without coughing or feeling discomfort, rule out COVID-19?
No. Breath exercises cannot diagnose any disease. Only laboratory tests can determine if someone has COVID-19 or no.

¿Does being able to smell and taste wine or vinegar rule out COVID-19?
No. There are other diseases which could cause loos of taste and smell. Drinking alcoholic beverages in excess is harmful.

# [treatment:healing] TREATMENT
As COVID-19 symptoms could be different from person to person, the treatment also is different. Severe COVID-19 needs oxygen and other drugs depending on the disease course. The right and early treatment can avoid complications and even death.

¿If someone on treatment for another disease have COVID-19, should they stop their previous treatment?
No. A person who previously is taking anticoagulant (warfarin), antiplatelet (aspirin), antihypertensive (captopril, enalapril, losartan), statins (atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin), corticosteroid (dexamethasone, prednisone), NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac, celecoxib) drugs should continue their treatment, whatever has or has not COVID-19.
This person must go to their doctor because their previous disease could be a risk factor to develop a severe COVID-19.

¿Could Remdesivir be used as general COVID-19 treatment?
No. In the USA, Remdesivir is approved as COVID-19 treatment for hospitalized patients who need oxygen.1 But, WHO recommends wait for more evidence of its effectiveness.

¿Could Dexamethasone be used as general COVID-19 treatment?
No. Dexamethasone is only recommended for hospitalized COVID-19 patients who need oxygen.

¿Can Hydroxychloroquine or Chloroquine cure or prevent COVID-19?	
To date, there isn’t evidence suggesting the Hydroxychloroquine or Chloroquine cure or prevent COVID-19. Unnecessary use of these drugs could produce serious adverse effects.

¿Can Ivermectin cure or prevent COVID-19?
To date, there isn’t evidence to support that Ivemectin prevent or cure COVID-19.

¿Can antibiotics prevent or cure COVID-19?
No. Antibiotics do not work against virus. Some people with COVID-19 could get a bacterial infection as complication and antibiotics are indicated by doctors.

¿Why taking antibiotics is not convenient to prevent or cure COVID-19?
Antibiotics are against bacteria. If we take antibiotics unnecessarily, bacteria could become resistant to these drugs and in the near future antibiotics can no longer kill bacteria. Only doctors could determine if antibiotics are needed or not.

¿Can vitamin C, vitamin D and Zinc prevent or cure COVID-19?
To date, there isn’t evidence. Vitamin C, vitamin D and Zinc are supplements which help the immune system to work well, they do not cure or prevent COVID-19.

¿Can the blood of people who recovered from COVID-19 be used as COVID-19 treatment?
To date, there isn’t evidence. It is unknown if blood or antibodies of people who have had COVID-19 and then recovered could treat COVID-19 in other people.

¿Can Chlorine Dioxide (ClO2) prevent or cure COVID-19?
No. Chlorine dioxide is a gas used in water treatment plants. Drinking ClO2 can cause serious consequences, even death.

# [prevention:block] PREVENTION 
## [drugs:pills] Preventive measures
Wearing or not wearing mask (face cover), we should:
- Avoid being in crowded places.
- Handwashing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. We could use hand sanitizer if our hands do not look dirty.
- Keep 6 feet (2 meters) apart from others. Doing so we prevent get infected or infect other if we are sick.
- If we cough or sneeze, we must cover our nose and mouth with a tissue or our elbow, throw the dirty tissue to the rubbish and then wash our hands.
- Do not touch eyes, nose or mouth without wash our hands before.
- Keep windows opened and avoid stuffy places.

¿Is there any drug to prevent COVID-19?
To date, there isn’t any drug which can prevent COVID-19.

¿When to wear a mask?
We should wear a mask properly if we have to be in a crowded place and cannot keep a distance of 6 feet (2 meters) from others.8,23

## [masks:headSideMask] Masks (face cover)
¿What steps we must follow to wear a mask (face cover) properly? 
- Wash our hands before putting on the mask.
- Make sure of covering mouth and nose with the mask, adjust it to the nasal bone, and fast it in order to decrease spaces between the mask and the face.
- Avoid touching the mask while we are wearing it.
- To remove the mask, unfasten or untie the mask from behind without touching it. 
- Wash our hands after removing or touching the mask.
- If the mask gets wet or dirty, let’s change it for a new and dry mask.
- We should change of mask at least every day.
- Never reuse a disposable mask, we have to change it for a new one after each wearing.

¿What could happen if I do not wear a mask (face cover) properly?
- We could contaminate us if we touch the mask and then touch our eyes, nose and mouth without wash our hands before.
- We could contaminate us if we do not change the mask when it gets dirty or wet.
- We could have breathing difficulty if we did not choose the suitable mask. It is important to choose a mask that fits us and through we can breathe - comfortably.
- If we wear a mask for a long period, it could cause skin irritation. Let’s choose a mask that doesn’t bother us.
- Could make communication difficult, especially for deaf-mute people. To avoid this problem, there are masks with a transparent portion.
- We may have a sense of false security and do not continue practicing the most important preventive measures, such as handwashing, physical distance and - covering nose/mouth when coughing/sneezing.
- Rubbish increasing. We could avoid it wearing a cloth mask.

¿What benefits there are if we wear a mask (face cover) properly?
- We reduce the transmission risk, avoiding getting infected or spreading the virus if we are sick. 
- Decrease stigmatization (discrimination) of people who regularly have to wear a mask due to other diseases, like Tuberculosis.
- Have a feeling that we can help in some way to stop the spreading of the COVID-19 virus.
- Make us remember that we should follow the other preventive measures, such as handwashing, physical distance and covering mouth/face when coughing/- sneezing.
- We could have an extra income if we make reusable masks and sell them. Wearing cloth masks are cheaper and reduce the amount of rubbish generated by disposable masks.

¿What are the recommendations for the manufacture and washing of a fabric/cloth mask?
- The fabric should retain small drops. Also, it should be easy to breathe through the cloth.
- Do not use elastic cloth to make the mask, as it cannot be washed with hot water as the fabric will stretch.
- Use fabric that can resist high temperatures (60°C or more).
- A cloth mask should have at least 3 layers: the inner layer that is in contact with the mouth and nose could be of cotton or a cotton blend cloth (can - absorb fluid), the middle layer could be polypropylene or cotton, and the outer layer could be polypropylene, polyester, or a blend of both (cannot - absorb fluid)
- A fabric mask should be washed frequently, without scrubbing too much.
- Do not wash cloth masks with other clothes.
- Check on the mask label what is the higher temperature it could be washed. A mask made of polyester could resist up to 140°C.
- If there isn’t hot water, wash fabric masks with soap or detergent and then boil them for 1 minute.
¿Could we wear just a face shield?
No. The face shield should always be wearing with a mask or face cover.

?Should children wear a mask?
Children younger than 2 don't need to  wear a mask.

¿Can wearing a mask for a long time cause carbon dioxide (CO2) intoxication or oxygen deficiency?
No. Wearing a mask for a long period could be annoyed, but it does not cause carbon dioxide intoxication either oxygen deficiency. Let’s choose a comfortable mask which enabled us to breathe easily through it.

¿Should a mask be wearing while doing exercise?
No. Someone who is doing exercise shouldn’t wear a mask as breathing is uncomfortable. Also, the mask gets wet with sweating making breathe even more difficult and making microbes grow in the mask.9 The main measure while doing exercise is to keep 2 or at least 1 meter apart from others.

## [rumors:users] Rumors about prevention
There are hearsays about COVID-19 prevention that could be very harmful if we practice them.

¿Does fumigating houses or offices prevent COVID-19?
No. Fumigate a closed place such as house, office, health center is not recommended because it can harm people health. To disinfect a place, it should be cleaned with water and detergent to take out the dirt first, and then, apply a disinfectant with a cloth enabling the disinfectant to cover all surfaces.

¿Does fumigating streets prevent COVID-19?
No. Fumigate open places such as streets or markets do not kill the virus of COVID-19. Disinfectants do not work with dirt. Moreover, when fumigate, disinfectants do not cover all surfaces to remove the virus.

¿Does fumigating or spraying people with disinfectants prevent COVID-19?
No. Fumigate or spray people with any disinfectant do not decrease the risk of COVID-19 virus transmission. These substances can cause breathing difficulty, vomits and skin/eyes irritation.

¿Does introducing bleach into someone prevent COVID-19?
No. Introducing bleach into the body can be dangerous and even deadly. Bleach or other disinfectant has to be used only to disinfect objects or surfaces like chairs, handles, stair handrail floors, walls.

¿Does drinking alcohol, methanol, ethanol or bleach prevent or cure COVID-19?
No. Methanol, ethanol (medical alcohol to disinfect) and bleach are harmful if they are drunk, causing even death. These substance are only to disinfect objects or surfaces, but they never be drunk.

¿Does vaporizing eucalyptus prevent COVID-19?
There isn’t evidence that eucalyptus can kill any virus or bacteria.

¿Does cold weather kill the COVID-19 virus?
No. Cold weather with snowing doesn’t kill the COVID-19 virus. Body temperature is around 36.5°C and 37°C whatever the environment temperature is.

¿Does hot weather kill the COVID-19 virus?
No. Hot weather doesn’t kill any virus. COVID-19 transmission can increase in cold weathers because people spend more time indoors with closed windows.

¿Can UV lamps disinfect hands or other body parts?
No. Ultraviolet lamp cannot disinfect any part of our body. UV rays can cause skin and eyes irritation.

¿Can hand dryers kill the COVID-19 virus?
No. Hand dryers cannot kill the coronavirus. We should wash our hands with water and soap first before dry them (using a cloth/paper towel or a warm air dryer).

¿Does taking a hot bath prevent COVID-19?
No. Bathing with very hot water can cause burns. Body temperature is around 36.5°C and 37°C whatever environmental temperature is.

¿Does eating hot pepper or spicy food prevent or cure COVID-19?
No. Chili or hot pepper can empower meals taste, but they don’t prevent or cure COVID-19.

¿Does exposing to the sun or temperatures higher than 25°C prevent COVID-19?
No. Exposing to the sun doesn’t prevent COVID-19.

¿Does rinsing mouth or nose with saline prevent COVID-19?
No. Rinsing mouth or nose with saline could improve cold symptoms, but it doesn’t prevent or kill the COVID-19 virus.

¿Does eating ginger or garlic prevent COVID-19?
No. Ginger and garlic can empower our meals, but there isn’t evidence that they could prevent COVID-19.

## [vaccine:syringe] Vaccines
Vaccines are essential to protect the health and economy of people, helping to the development and economy of the country.
In Africa, for every COVID-19 death of a person who was infected when they brought their child to be vaccinated, (at least) 80 deaths of children who were vaccinated are prevented.

¿How do vaccines work?
Vaccines train our body how to recognize and defend itself against viruses and bacteria, reducing the risk of the disease occurring.

¿Is there any vaccine to prevent COVID-19?
Yes. There are 3 vaccines with emergency approvals in different countries.

¿Can COVID-19 vaccine stop the pandemic?
COVID-19 vaccine is one of the biggest measures to stop the pandemic. However, we should continue following the other measures such as handwashing, physical distance, cover mouth/nose when coughing/sneezing, and wearing a mask properly.

¿What types of COVID-19 vaccines are in trials and how they work?
Inactivated vaccines: it is used inactivated or weakened COVID-19 viruses, they make our body to produce antibodies without getting sick.
Protein-based vaccines: it is used parts of the COVID-19 virus (proteins) that don’t cause the illness but make our body recognize them as foreign and learn how to defend itself of future infections.
RNA and DNA vaccines: it is used genes of the virus that produce parts (proteins) of COVID-19 virus, our body destroys them and learns how to defend itself against the virus.
Viral vector vaccines: it is used other weakened viruses and added genes of COVID-19 virus, in our body it is produced part of the virus (protein) that is recognized as foreign and then is removed.

¿Does the protection of the COVID-19 vaccine is forever?
It is unknown, more researches are needed to clarify how long the protection of the COVID-19 vaccines would be.

¿How to know if COVID-19 vaccines are safe?
There are many researches have been doing to check the effectivity and safety of COVID-19 vaccines. Based on the outcomes of these studies, different countries have approved the emergency use of these vaccines. This process is very rigorous and has been doing with all vaccines we use nowadays.

¿What adverse effects could cause COVID-19 vaccine?
Pain and swelling of the shot arm, fever, chills, tiredness, headache. These are suggesting that our body is producing defenses.

¿Are COVID-19 vaccines part of a “program for mass extermination”?
No. There isn’t any program for mass extermination. Different organizations are working to keep the population as healthy as possible. The most important aim of vaccines is to be safe, it has been checking in many researches.

¿Could COVID-19 vaccines produce infertility?
No. There is too many fake news about vaccines that cause fear and distrust to people, so they don’t want to get vaccinated. It is quite harmful to the most effective preventive measure, vaccination.

¿Do pneumonia vaccines prevent or protect against COVID-19?
No. Pneumonia vaccines as pneumococcal and Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) do not protect against COVID-19 virus. COVID-19 virus needs its own vaccine. However, it is recommended to get these vaccines to prevent other causes of pneumonia.

¿Does Influenza vaccine prevent COVID-19?
No. The Influenza virus is a different virus than the COVID-19 virus, despite their symptoms are quite similar.1 However, it is recommended that people who recovered from COVID-19 get vaccinated against Influenza.

¿What is the benefit of diphtheria vaccination?
The benefit of diphtheria vaccination is to prevent diphtheria, and, prevent another disease from hitting us. Due to the pandemic, many children and adults who should have got vaccinated didn’t so there are vaccines available to be used.

# WHEN THERE IS SOMEONE SICK AT HOME
¿What we should do if we have COVID-19 symptoms?
- Stay at home. We should only get out to go to the doctor or hospital.
- Seek for medical care calling a doctor as soon as symptoms begin.
- Do rest and not stress. Having good mental health is important.
- Drink water to keep hydrated.
- Stay in a separate room, with opened windows.
- Use an independent bathroom, if it is possible.
- Keep windows opened enabling fresh air in the house. More fresh air, less viruses.
- Avoid sharing common areas like the living room, dining room, kitchen, and when we do it should be the lesser time possible.
- Practice preventive measures such as handwashing, physical distance and covering nose/mouth when coughing/sneezing.
- Wear a medic mask most of the time, change a mask every day. If wearing a mask is impossible, cover mouth/nose with a tissue when sneezing/coughing or - speaking/laughing and then through the dirty tissue to the rubbish.
- Avoid contaminating things or surfaces with saliva or respiratory secretions (mucus or sputum), it reduces the risk of virus transmission.
- Clean and disinfect things and surfaces we touched frequently.
- Avoid being close to animals or pets.

¿What we should do if there is someone with COVID-19 at home, with diagnostic test or not?
- Choose a person to care for the sick one, if it is possible, this person should not be pregnant or at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19.
- If we care for a sick person, we could get infected and transmit the COVID-19 virus to others. It is extremely important to practice all the preventive - measures such as handwashing, physical distance, covering mouth/nose when coughing/sneezing and wear a mask.
- Wash hands with soap and water before and after touch the sick person. If our hands don’t look dirty we could use hand sanitizer. 
- Stay 6 feet (2 meters) apart from the sick person.
- Do not be face to face to the sick person.
- Wear a mask when being in the bedroom of the sick person.
- Remove all things contaminated with secretions of the sick person like tissues, and then practice handwashing with soap and water.
- Keep windows opened.
- Clean and disinfect things that the sick person uses or touches.

¿What disinfectants we could use against COVID-19?
- Ethanol at 70- 90% (medical alcohol used before a shot)
- Chlorine based products (like bleach) at 0.1% for general disinfection and at 0.5% for places with blood and body secretions. 
- Hydrogen peroxide >0.5% (oxygenated water).
- These substances should cover the surface for at least 1 minute to be disinfected (or depending on the maker indications).
